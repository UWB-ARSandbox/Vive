# Vive-2.0
## Installation
Install at the directory of choice with the following cmd command:

`git clone https://github.com/UWB-ARSandbox/Vive-2.0.git --recursive`

Be sure to include the `--recursive` command, as this will also clone the submodules (including the very important 'Networking' module!)
